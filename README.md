## Purpose of project

The purpose of the code is to implement an API for a bank account that allows users to create an account, 
list all accounts and transfer funds between accounts.

Furthermore, it also handles authentication of users before they can transfers funds.

A very "small" frontend has also been developed and can be found at - https://github.com/Falderebet/bank-frontend
